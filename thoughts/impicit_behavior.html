Explicit is better than implicit - The Zen of Python

Computers let us see the Mandelbrot set.

The program isn't complicated:
	"mandlebrot program"

But the picture *is*:
	"mandlebrot picture"

The consequences of a rule, are larger than the rule.

I like consequences, and dislike explicit programs, or rather I'm skeptical of "explicit" programs. I want to talk about why.

*Begin with an explicit program, and show how it can be reduced to a simple system*
*Show how any particular explicit theory, readily implies some other explicit theory,
show this by illustrating two different interfaces implemented in terms of the other, use examples from physics*

Mechanics in particular can be reformulated in a couple different ways.


"Claims: proofs can be about understanding, rather than correctness.
For example, they can help us understand implicit, or implied, properties.
This point of view lets programs be simpler"
